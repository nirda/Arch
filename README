This is the README file for exercise 1 in CG 2012.
In this ex we created an application to intuitively view 3D object.

included files:

ex1.cpp - the main aplictaion file. it is inchrage of all the actions done on the Gl window
			in this exercise.
ex1.h - the header file for ex1.

In our implementation we keep two matrix:
currRotationMat - which we change during the movment of the mouse.
actionsMat - which we only change after the mouse is unclicked.

we use the PROJECTION matrix for scaling (zooming in and out) the object.
and the MODELVIEW matrix for moving and rotating.

If the displayed object is not the cube object
when pressed 'a', the shown animation is rotating the mesh object
